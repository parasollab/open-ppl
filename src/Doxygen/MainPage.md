## About the Parasol Laboratory
The Parasol Laboratory is a focal point for research related to next-generation computing languages and systems and for the development of algorithms and applications that exploit these to solve computation and/or data intensive applications. Due to its application-centric focus, the Parasol Lab creates a uniquely favorable environment for multidisciplinary collaboration between systems and application developers.

Parasol software and systems projects include: the study and development of novel algorithmic, architecture and compiler techniques for the optimization of parallel and distributed systems, the design and implementation of compiler driven software productivity improvement tools, software verification, and performance modeling and prediction.

Parasol applications projects include: the development of optimized algorithms
for applications from domains such as computer-aided design (CAD), computational biology, computational geophysics, computational neuroscience, computational physics, robotics, and virtual reality.
