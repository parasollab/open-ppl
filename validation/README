This directory contains the validation scripts used to test the pmpl code.

- pmpl_nightly_src.pl:
    Checks out a fresh copy of the code from svn and checks compilation to be free of error.
    It outputs a log file to <machine_name>:$outputdir
    It sends a confirmation email to $ADMIN_MAILTO when it completes
    It should be called via a cron job every night, once for each different configuration tested
    It assumes that $workdir exists

    options:
       -c [platform type: e.g., LINUX_gcc]
       -r [robot type: rigid, surface, reach]
       -d [debugging option: 0, 1]
       -p [parallel option: 0, 1]
       (currently only LINUX_gcc and parallel=0 are supported)

    configurable variables:
      $outputdir: the location where the log file is output to
      $ADMIN_MAILTO: the email address of the administrator for the conformation of completeness emails
      $workdir: the location where the code is checked out to and tested

- pmpl_nightly_src_mail.pl:
    this checks the log files in $cron_machine:$outputdir and sends a summary email of the results to $MAILTO
    it should be called via a cron job every night, after all the pmpl_nightly_src.pl calls have completed
    it looks at the log files from the same date as when it is run

    options:
       none

    configurable variables:
       $outputdir = the location where the log files are stored
       $cron_machine = the machine where $outputdir resides
       $MAILTO = the email where the summary is sent

    to add a new configuration to search the logs for, add a new call to get_error_code() in the list

- pmpl_nightly_doc.pl:
    Checks out a fresh copy of the code from svn and checks compilation of documentation to be free of error.
    It outputs a log file to <machine_name>:$outputdir
    It sends a confirmation email to $ADMIN_MAILTO when it completes
    It should be called via a cron job every night, once for each different configuration tested
    It assumes that $workdir exists

    options:
       none

    configurable variables:
      $outputdir: the location where the log file is output to
      $ADMIN_MAILTO: the email address of the administrator for the conformation of completeness emails
      $workdir: the location where the code is checked out to and tested
