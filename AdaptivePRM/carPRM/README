There are three robot files in the CarLike environments:
 * car.g:     the original 12x5 car.
 * carReal.g: the same as car.g exept that its center of mass has been moved 
              from the center of the robot to the middle of the rear axle. This 
              makes the car's motion more natural.
 * carCore.g: an approximation of carReal.g.

For car-like robots, two roadmaps are built: a control roadmap and a "real" roadmap.

For best results, carCore.g should be used during roadmap construction (for both the 
control roadmap and the "real" roadmap) and carReal.g should be used during the query 
stage. This will allow for fast roadmap construction and natural paths. For now, 
this is achieved by modifying the .env file.
