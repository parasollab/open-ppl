There will be one test set for each type of trait/compile. Each test is placed
in the file for that trait/compile as:

<XML_filename> <Output_file_to_diff_1> ... <Output_file_to_diff_n>

Where:
<XML_filename> is a file located in XMLs representing the test. Name very
  precisely for what the test actually tests. In naming, if some component is
  not named, then defaults are assumed, i.e., Euclidean, Uniform, SL, etc. For
  example, BasicPRM.xml, tests the BasicPRM strategy on default items implying
  the distance metric is Euclidean, sampling is uniform, and local planning is
  straight-line.
<Output_file_to_diff_1> is a file located in Ouput and generated by
  <XML_filename>. The output of pmpl on <XML_filename> and the known output if
  diff compared for errors.

If <XML_filename> needs any inputs, e.g., a map or path file, place these in
Input.

Ensure all outputs of <XML_filename> point to Scratch folder. Essentially, each
<XML_filename> will be run from Tests/ NOT FROM XMLs/, make sure it is set up
properly.

All environments will be located in Envs/.

All test xml files should be MINIMAL, i.e., only specify objects that are used!

Before checking any code in, ensure all tests run correctly.

If a bug is found in PMPL:
  Upon fixing the bug, place a new test XML which exhibited the bug along with
  the environment which displayed if (only if a new one is required).
