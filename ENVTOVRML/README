The program readenv is designed to convert an environment file (*.env), and 
its associated files (*.g),  into a VRML file (*.wrl) with the appropriate 
colors (if applicable).
 
readenv takes two command-line parameters: the enviroment file (*.env), and 
the output file (*.wrl). 

Future updates will include: Wireframe switches, a heads-up display, roadmaps,
and paths.
