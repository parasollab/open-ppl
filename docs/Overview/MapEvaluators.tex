\chapter{Roadmap Evaluators}

Roadmap, or just Map, Evaluators (\me) are used to determine when roadmap
construction is finished. Essentially they process the roadmap to see if some
boolean condition is met, such as being able to solve a query or having certain
properties, etc.

%% Base Class
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{\texttt{MapEvaluatorMethod}}

\texttt{MapEvaluatorMethod} has one main function \CALL{operator()}. This
applies the evaluation and returns a boolean pass/fail value. Usage:
\begin{lstlisting}
MapEvaluatorPointer me = this->GetMPProblem()->GetMapEvaluator(m_meLabel);
bool passed = (*me)(); //call as a function object
bool passed2 = me->operator()(); //call with pointer notation
\end{lstlisting}
