\chapter{Metrics}

Metrics (\metr) compute some value over the roadmap, e.g., coverage,
connectivity, number of nodes, number of edges, etc.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% Base Class
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{\texttt{MetricMethod}}

\texttt{MetricMethod} has one main function \CALL{operator()} which returns the
value associated with the roadmap for that metric. Usage:
\begin{lstlisting}
MetricPointer m = this->GetMPProblem()->GetMetric(m_mLabel);
double v = (*m)(); //call as function object
double v2 = m->operator()(); //call with pointer notation
\end{lstlisting}
