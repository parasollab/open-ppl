\chapter{Neighborhood Finders}

Neighborhood Finders (\nf) are a key component to most sampling-based motion
planning algorithms. Essentially, given an input configuration they return a set
of ``nearby'' configurations. This can be done in an approximate fashion or with
an exact computation. These are used in \rrts\ to find the nearest node, and by
\prms\ to determine a set of candidate edges for validation.

\section{\texttt{NeighborhoodFinderMethod}}

\texttt{NeighborhoodFinderMethod} has two important functions,
$\CALL{FindNeighbors}$ and $\CALL{FindNeighborPairs}$.

$\CALL{FindNeighbors}$ takes an input configuration and a set of candidate
neighbors and returns the computed set of ``nearest'' neighbors. Usage:
\begin{lstlisting}
NeighborhoodFinderPointer nf = this->GetMPProblem()->GetNeighborhoodFinder(m_nfLabel);
CfgType c;
vector<pair<VID, double> > neighbors;
nf->FindNeighbors(this->GetMPProblem()->GetRoadmap(), c, back_inserter(neighbors));
\end{lstlisting}
A roadmap must be specified as the set of candidate neighbors must be located
within this graph.

$\CALL{FindNeighborPairs}$ determines the ``closest'' pairs of configurations
betweeen two sets of nodes located in a roadmap. Usage:
\begin{lstlisting}
NeighborhoodFinderPointer nf = this->GetMPProblem()->GetNeighborhoodFinder(m_nfLabel);
vector<VID> c1, c2;
vector<pair<pair<VID, VID>, double> > neighbors;
nf->FindNeighbors(this->GetMPProblem()->GetRoadmap(), c1.begin(), c1.end(),
c2.begin(), c2.end(), back_inserter(neighbors));
\end{lstlisting}
