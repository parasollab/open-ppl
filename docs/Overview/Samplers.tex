\chapter{Samplers}

A Sampler (\samp) is defined as an algorithm which generates configurations in
$\cspace$,however this is typically restricted to $\cfree$. They either take in
a number of desired samples or a set of input configurations to apply the
algorithm too.

\section{\texttt{SamplerMethod}}

\texttt{SamplerMethod} has two sets of important functions. The first are the
various public methods in the base class, $\CALL{Sample}$, and second is the
private virtual function which the derived classes overload, $\CALL{Sampler}$.

$\CALL{Sample}$ is called in various ways, see \texttt{SamplerMethod.h} for a
full list, but they break down into two forms: desired number and input
configurations. When specifying a desired number $n$ of configurations the
sampler attempts $a$ attempters per desired sample. The output is placed on an
output iterator like so:
\begin{lstlisting}
SamplerPointer s = this->GetMPProblem()->GetSampler(m_sLabel);
int num, attempts;
vector<CfgType> result;
s->Sample(this->GetMPProblem()->GetEnvironment(),
          this->GetMPProblem()->GetStatClass(),
          num, attempts, back_inserter(result));
\end{lstlisting}
The other form of $\CALL{Sample}$ sends a list of input configurations to apply
the sampler rule to:
\begin{lstlisting}
SamplerPointer s = this->GetMPProblem()->GetSampler(m_sLabel);
vector<CfgType> input;
int attempts;
vector<CfgType> result;
s->Sample(this->GetMPProblem()->GetEnvironment(),
          this->GetMPProblem()->GetStatClass(),
          input.begin(), input.end(), attempts, back_inserter(result));
\end{lstlisting}
There are other versions of this method with the option to return the failed
attempts, specify the boundary used for sampling, etc.

$\CALL{Sampler}$ is the private virtual function responsible for taking as input
a single input configuration and applying the sampler rule to generate one or
more configurations.
