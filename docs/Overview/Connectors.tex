\chapter{Connectors}

Connectors (\c) orchestrate the creation of edges within a sampling-based
planner. More loosely, the combine a neighbor selection phase to determine
candidate edges and validate these with a local planner. If a local planner
succeeds then the edge is added to the roadmap. These algorithms vary in the
ways they do this.

\section{\texttt{ConnectorMethod}}

\texttt{ConnectorMethod} essentially has one important function,
$\CALL{Connect}$ which can be called in a multitude of ways. In its basic forms
it takes two sets of configurations and generates edges in the roadmap between
them. Usage:
\begin{lstlisting}
ConnectorPointer c = this->GetMPProblem()->GetConnector(m_cLabel);
ColorMapType cm;
vector<VID> c1, c2;
c->Connect(this->GetMPProblem()->GetRoadmap(), this->GetMPProblem()->GetStatClass(), cmap, c1.begin(), c1.end(), c2.begin(), c2.end());
\end{lstlisting}
Where ColorMapType is the type of a color map for the underlying STAPL graph.
