\chapter{Local Planners}

A Local Planner (\lp) is basically a validity checker for simple paths between
two configurations. These planners are typically efficient, deterministic, and
incomplete. We often use these to validate edges of our roadmaps. Paths are
defined as polygonal chains $P = \{q_1, q_2, \ldots q_n\}$ through $\cspace$.

\section{\texttt{LocalPlannerMethod}}

\texttt{LocalPlannerMethod} has two main functions, $\CALL{IsConnected}$ and
$\CALL{ReconstructPath}$.

$\CALL{IsConnected}$ takes as input two configurations $c_1$, $c_2$, an
\texttt{LPOutput}, validation resolutions, and optional booleans dictating
whether to check collision and save the path. The function both returns true or
false to validate the simple path between $c_1$ and $c_2$, but also populated
the \texttt{LPOutput} structure with useful information. Usage is as follows:
\begin{lstlisting}
LocalPlannerPointer lp = this->GetMPProblem()->GetLocalPlanner(m_lpLabel);
Environment* env = this->GetMPProblem()->GetEnvironment();
CfgType c1, c2;
LPOutput<MPTraits> lpOut;
lp->IsConnected(c1, c2, &lpOut, env->GetPositionRes(), env->GetOrientationRes());
\end{lstlisting}

$\CALL{ReconstructPath}$ is used to reconstruct a specific polygonal chain from
a \texttt{DefaultWeight} object's intermediate configurations. The function
takes as input two configurations, a set of intermediate configurations, and
validity resolutions. Usage is as follows:
\begin{lstlisting}
LocalPlannerPointer lp = this->GetMPProblem()->GetLocalPlanner(m_lpLabel);
Environment* env = this->GetMPProblem()->GetEnvironment();
CfgType c1, c2;
vector<CfgType> intermediates;
lp->IsConnected(c1, c2, intermediates, env->GetPositionRes(), env->GetOrientationRes());
\end{lstlisting}
