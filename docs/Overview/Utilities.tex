\section{Motion Planning Utilities - \texttt{MPUtils}}

\texttt{MPUtils} is a general storage area of miscellaneous defines, and basic
motion planning classes used in \pmpl. The main object here is
\texttt{MPBaseObject} upon which all algorithmic abstractions extend themselves
off of.

\section{Metric Utilities - \texttt{MetricUtils}}

The metric utilities are a set of statistical analysis and statistics tracking
utilities.

%% Clock
\subsection{\texttt{Clock}}

\texttt{Clock}s are used as a timing method in \pmpl\ to time algorithm's
runtime.

%% Stat Class
\subsection{\texttt{StatClass}}

The \texttt{StatClass} is a storage hub of all statistics to be tracked in
\pmpl, including timing, success/fail attempts, collision detection calls, etc.

\texttt{PMPLExceptions} are objects which methods can throw for their various
errors, These are all runtime errors and facilitate recovery for programs like
Vizmo and aid users in identifying where and how errors occur.
