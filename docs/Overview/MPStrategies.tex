\chapter{Motion Planning Strategies}

Motion Planning Strategies (\mps) essentially orchestrate creation of roadmaps
for use to solve motion planning problems. They are the ``solvers'' or the
algorithms to solve a problem, e.g., \prm\ or \rrt. They are not restricted to
solving motion planning problems, but could be as simple as load a previously
constructed roadmap and evaluate it, etc. These are what are ``executed'' when
calling the \textit{pmpl} executable.

\section{\texttt{MPStrategyMethod}}

\texttt{MPStrategyMethod} has one main function, $\CALL{operator()}$, which
performs preprocessing, processing, and postprocessing functionalities of the
algorithms. Usage:
\begin{lstlisting}
MPStrategyPointer mps = this->GetMPProblem()->GetMPStrategy(m_mpsLabel);
(*mps)(); //call as a function object
mps->operator()(); //call with pointer notation
\end{lstlisting}
