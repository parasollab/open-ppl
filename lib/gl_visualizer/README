This utility is a generic visualizer based on OpenGL. To use it, create a
visualization class that inherits from the base_visualization class (see
example_visualization for a demo).

What's in here:

nonstd:
  A collection of utilities that aren't in the std namespace but reasonably
  could belong there, like approximate equality and a string tokenizer.

glutils:
  A collection of utilities for working with OpenGL, like camera and transform
  objects.

sandbox:
  The visualizer code, which is based on Qt. Run make from this folder to build
  the visualizer.
