The files in this directory are copies of the corresponding file in the
Boost 1.63 distribution.  The files are copied here because they have been
modified to either:

1. Provide define_type functions to a data structure so it can be serialized and
sent as a parameter of an RMI request, or

2. In order to eliminate warnings and workaround bugs in the implementation
provided by the Boost distribution (i.e., to pull in trac patches or commits to
the Boost repository).

The set of files copied from Boost and the reason for the copy are below.


bind/*
=====
Added define_type functions to the data structures.


graph/detail/adj_list_edge_iterator.hpp
=====
The edges data members are instances of Boost.Optional, and the unconditional
comparison of edges.first causes gcc to issue a warning.  Checking to ensure the
data members are initialized before performing the comparison eliminates the
warning.

See https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/5706 for details and progress from
Boost on resolving the issue in the release.


icl/concept/container.hpp
=====
Adding template parameter to swap so that when std::swap and boost::icl::swap
are both valid for the parameters being passed
(e.g., std::tuple<boost::interval_set<int> > ) the std::swap implementation
will be used as it requires fewer substitutions.  This modification was based
on the approach discussed in https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/2839 .
https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/9624 was opened to report the issue.


icl/*
=====
Added define_type functions to the data structures.


multi_array.hpp multi_array/*
=====
Added define_type functions to the data structures.

serialization/*
=====
Files downloaded from https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/5265 include
Boost.Serialization support for boost unordered containers. Extentions ported
to the files provided in Boost releases since 1.56.
