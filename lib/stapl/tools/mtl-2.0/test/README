There are four different types of test to run, which are controlled by
the value of the QUICK macro in the makefile.

1) To run a comprehensive test of all algorithms and all datatypes

  make test QUICK=

This will probably take about 12 hours to complete
(Perhaps in 2001 when mtl was last updated... but in 2005,
it only takes about 4 minutes on a AMD64 3000+... YMMV - jkp)

2) To run a test comprehensive in data types but on only one
algorithm, 

  make test QUICK=-Q

3) To run a test comprehensive in algorithms but on only one
data type

  make test QUICK=-q

4) To run a sanity test that checks only one algorithm and one data
type 

  make test QUICK=-qQ

5) To combine tests 2 and 3 in one test

  make test QUICK=-p

Test number 4 is the default

The output of the tests will be left in the file
./make_and_test_results.txt.  You can post-process the output file by
issuing the command

  make summary
