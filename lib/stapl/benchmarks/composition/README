The sweeps benchmark performs a computation whose shape is similar to that of
PDT.  Currently the code only contains the 8 independent sweeps.  It will be
expanded to include a convergence test that will execute the while pattern and a
timestep loop to further exercise the nested composition of PARAGRAPHS.

Currently the code only runs when the STAPL_EXECUTOR_WINDOW_SIZE and
STAPL_EXECUTOR_RETIRE_CHUNK environment variables are set to 8 or higher.

The benchmark now uses nested parallelism and is capable of executing with
thread support. This is done by adding
  CXXFLAGS +=-DSTAPL_RUNTIME_USE_OMP -fopenmp
or
  USER_CXXFLAGS +=-DSTAPL_RUNTIME_USE_OMP -fopenmp
in GNUmakefile.platforms. You must also do
 $ export OMP_NUM_THREADS=PX*PY
(see parameters below) in your environment.


The parameters for the benchmark are:

NX - The number of cells in the X dimension.
NY - The number of cells in the Y dimension.
NZ - The number of cells in the Z dimension.

 A - The agggregation factor used in each dimension at each level of nesting to
     create the hierarchical cellset graph.

 L - The number of levels of nested parallelism to employ.  The benchmark
     supports values from 1 to 5.

PX - The number of locations in the X dimension.
PY - The number of locations in the Y dimension.


The number of cells in a dimension must be A^(L+1).  Tested combinations and
their expected execution time when compiled with -O0 -g are below.

NX NY NZ  A  L PX PY   Expected Execution Time
 4  4  4  2  1  2  2   2 seconds
 8  8  8  2  2  2  2   2 seconds
16 16 16  2  3  2  2   20 seconds
32 32 32  2  4  2  2   200 seconds
64 64 64  2  5  2  2   2000 seconds

The increase in time is due to the oversubscription of the system as each nested
PARAGRAPH is run on as many locations as the original execution.
