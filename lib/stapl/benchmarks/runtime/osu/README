This directory contains implementations of the OSU microbenchmarks
(http://mvapich.cse.ohio-state.edu/benchmarks/) using the ARMI primitives.

All the benchmarks are based on the OSU microbenchmarks v4.3 and follow similar
communication patterns.

For information on which primitives each benchmark stresses, you can use
  $ <benchmark-name> --help


IMPLEMENTED BENCHMARKS

== async_rmi_acc_latency ==

Measures the latency for doing a remote asynchronous accumulate. The sender
location sends a buffer that has to be accumulated byte by byte to the
receiver's buffer.

It can be compared against:
 - omb/mpi/one-sided/osu_acc_latency.c


== async_rmi_bw ==

Measures the bandwidth of asynchronous primitives that send a buffer of bytes.

It can be compared against:
 - omb/mpi/one-sided/osu_put_bw.c
 - omb/mpi/pt2pt/osu_bw.c

The bi-directional benchmark ("--bidirectional" flag) can be compared against:
 - omb/mpi/one-sided/osu_put_bibw.c
 - omb/mpi/pt2pt/osu_bibw.c


== async_rmi_latency ==

Measures the latency of asynchronous primitives that send a buffer of bytes.

It can be compared against:
 - omb/mpi/one-sided/osu_put_latency.c
 - omb/mpi/pt2pt/osu_latency.c
 - omb/openshmem/osu_oshm_put.c

The pairs of locations benchmark ("--use_pairs" flag) can be compared against:
 - omb/upc/osu_upc_memput.c


== async_rmi_multi_lat ==

Measures the latency for doing a asynchronous puts between pairs of locations

It can be compared against:
 - omb/mpi/pt2pt/osu_multi_lat.c


== boost_mpi_latency ==

Measures the latency of boost::mpi::send / boost::mpi::recv.

It can be compared against:
 - omb/mpi/one-sided/osu_put_latency.c
 - omb/mpi/pt2pt/osu_latency.c
 - omb/openshmem/osu_oshm_put.c


== sync_rmi_acc_latency ==

Measures the latency for doing a remote get followed by an accumulate. The
sender location sends a buffer that has to be accumulated byte by byte to the
receiver's buffer. The receiver's buffer prior to the accumulation operation is
returned.

It can be compared against:
 - omb/mpi/one-sided/osu_get_acc_latency.c


== sync_rmi_bw ==

Measures the bandwidth of synchronous primitives that get a buffer of bytes.

It can be compared against:
 - omb/mpi/one-sided/osu_get_bw.c


== sync_rmi_cas_latency ==

Measures the latency for doing a remote compare-and-swap. The sender location
sends a long long int that has to be compared-and-swapped with the receiver's
and waits for the result.

It can be compared against:
 - omb/mpi/one-sided/osu_cas_latency.c


== sync_rmi_fop_latency ==

Measures the latency for doing a remote fetch-and-add. The sender location
sends a long long int that has to be added to the receiver's and waits for the
value before the addition.

It can be compared against:
 - omb/mpi/one-sided/osu_fop_latency.c


== sync_rmi_latency ==

Measures the latency of synchronous primitives that get a buffer of bytes.

It can be compared against:
 - omb/mpi/one-sided/osu_get_latency.c
 - omb/openshmem/osu_oshm_get.c

The pairs of locations benchmark ("--use_pairs" flag) can be compared against:
 - omb/upc/osu_upc_memget.c


== collective ===

Measures the latency of SPMD collective primitives.

It can be compared against:
  - omb/mpi/collective/osu_allgather.c  ("--primitive allgather_rmi" flag)
  - omb/mpi/collective/osu_allgatherv.c ("--primitive allgather_rmi" flag)
  - omb/mpi/collective/osu_allreduce.c  ("--primitive allreduce_rmi" flag)
  - omb/mpi/collective/osu_bcast.c      ("--primitive broadcast_rmi" flag)
  - omb/openshmem/osu_oshm_broadcast.c  ("--primitive broadcast_rmi" flag)
  - omb/openshmem/osu_oshm_reduce.c     ("--primitive allreduce_rmi" flag)


== one_sided_collective ===

Measures the latency of one-sided collective primitives.

It can be compared against:
  - omb/mpi/collective/osu_gather.c    ("--primitive opaque_rmi" flag)
  - omb/mpi/collective/osu_gatherv.c   ("--primitive opaque_rmi" flag)
  - omb/mpi/collective/osu_reduce.c    ("--primitive reduce_rmi" flag)
  - omb/mpi/collective/osu_bcast.c     ("--primitive async_rmi" flag)
  - omb/openshmem/osu_oshm_broadcast.c ("--primitive async_rmi" flag)


== sync ===

Measures the latency of synchronization primitives.

The barrier benchmark ("--primitive rmi_barrier" flag) can be compared against:
  - omb/mpi/collective/osu_barrier.c
  - omb/openshmem/osu_oshm_barrier.c

There is no equivalent of the fence benchmark ("--primitive rmi_fence" flag).


UNIMPLEMENTED BENCHMARKS

The following OSU benchmarks have not been implemented:
 - mpi/pt2pt/osu_latency_mt: In this benchmark, the sender process sends
   messages to the receiver process which has multiple threads and any of the
   threads can process the message. In ARMI, the RMIs have to have a specific
   target.
