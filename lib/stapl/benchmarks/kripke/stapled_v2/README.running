This implementation uses non-blocking PARAGRAPHs to implement the concurrent
execution of sweeps in all directions.  In order for this to work the STAPL
gang_executor that processes PARAGRAPHs has to be configured to allow all sweep
PARAGRAPHs to be active at the same time.  Set the following environment
variables to configure the executor correctly.

Environment Variable         Value
STAPL_EXECUTOR_WINDOW_SIZE     10
STAPL_EXECUTOR_RETIRE_CHUNK    10
